Palitronica provides **physics-based hardware assurance and cybersecurity solutions**, using its Anvil Checkpoint technology to detect counterfeits, manufacturing defects, and malicious modifications in electronics without needing design access, crucial for securing complex supply chains in defense, automotive, and critical infrastructure.

## What Palitronica does:

- **Hardware Assurance**: Identifies fake chips, material flaws, and unauthorized changes in electronics.
- **Supply Chain Security**: Protects against counterfeit parts and embedded threats in mission-critical systems.
- **Physics-Based Testing**: Uses RF reflectometry and signal analysis to find defects that traditional tests miss, even after assembly.
- **Black Box Testing**: Verifies electronics without needing proprietary design data, ideal for unknown or complex systems.
- **Detects Early Stage Issues**: Catches problems right after manufacturing (SMT) and even during final assembly.
