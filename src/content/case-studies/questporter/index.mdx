# Overview

Questporter is a utility built for University of Waterloo students to export Quest class schedules into **any major calendar application.** By focusing on simplicity and approachability, it eliminates the need for complex extensions or technical know-how: students can simply copy, paste, and generate a calendar file that works anywhere. Designed with **newer and non-technical students** in mind, Questporter makes managing schedules fast, intuitive, and stress-free.

Try [Questporter](https://questporter.rawsab.com/) out for yourself, or view the [source code](https://github.com/rawsab/quest-schedule-exporter).

## Software Architecture

Questporter builds on the open-source project [Trinovantes/Quest-Schedule-Exporter](https://github.com/Trinovantes/Quest-Schedule-Exporter), which originally handled schedule-to-iCalendar conversion in JavaScript. The backend logic was ported to TypeScript for stronger type safety and easier maintainability. All generation happens **fully client-side in the browser**, ensuring that student data never leaves their machine.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel (static hosting + deployment)
- **Data Handling:** iCalendar file generation (client-side only)

### Data Flow

</div>

### Key Enhancements

Questporter improves on the [tool by Trinovantes](https://github.com/Trinovantes/Quest-Schedule-Exporter) by adding **timezone support**, ensuring that classes always appear at their correct local time no matter where the calendar is viewed. Moreover, the calendar generation logic was **migrated to TypeScript**, making the codebase safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain compared to the original JavaScript version.

## Design Case Study

### User Experience Goals

The main priority was to design a tool that any student could use within seconds, without needing to understand technical details. **Questporter’s design had three key goals:**

1. **Approachability:** Simple instructions and step-by-step icons to reduces intimidation.
2. **Clarity:** A obvious copy–paste workflow with placeholders and examples.
3. **Simplicity:** No clutter or unnecessary features, making it lightweight for once-a-term use.

To meet these goals, **a straightforward flow was used**: the user copies schedule from Quest, pastes it into the input box, and generates a downloadable iCalendar file. For added clarity and personalization, **users can optionally use placeholders** like `@code`, `@location`, or `@prof` to adjust how events appear. 

Finally, with just a single click, the tool automatically downloads an **.ics file** to the user's device that works seamlessly with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and other apps, making the entire process **quick, intuitive, and non-technical.**

</div>


## Future Considerations

In the future, Questporter could allow students to save presets for their preferred placeholder configurations each term, making re-exports faster and more consistent. It could also support **direct syncing** with calendar providers such as Google Calendar or Outlook, removing the extra step of downloading and importing `.ics` files manually. 

Moreover, a **calendar preview mode** would give students a general idea of how their schedule will appear once imported, while an **instant preview system** could update the display in real time as placeholders or descriptions are adjusted, creating a responsive, fast, and confidence-building experience for users.
